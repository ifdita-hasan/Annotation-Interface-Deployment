Yeah, maybe I have. I guess I've been in situations when I was surprised and confused as to why a team couldn't just work together towards the common goal. Does that sound similar?",

Here's a blunt question- what do you want to do about it? Do you think you want to get better at being happy in this job? Or work towards getting another job?",
